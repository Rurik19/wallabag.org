## Some history, some thanks

[Three years ago, I started a little script, to replace the closed service I used to use](http://loeuillet.org/poche-pour-remplacer-instapaper-pocket-et-readability) (french article). It was a personal script, that I hosted on GitHub. I never realized that people could be interested with it.

[You are more than 8.900 users on Framabag](https://framabag.org/analytics/), [you are more than 1.800 fans on GitHub](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/stargazers), wallabag 1.x was downloaded more than 33.400 times, [we released so many versions](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/releases.html) with so many features, and our history can still go on.

To all of our users: **Merci**.

If our project is still alive today, it's also thanks to Thomas Citharel ([@tcitworld](https://twitter.com/tcitworld)). When I was not available for the project, he was always here to fix bugs or to reply to your questions. **Merci Thomas**!

wallabag v2 is in my head for more than 2 years. But this version that we release today is also here thanks to Jérémy Benoist ([@j0k](https://twitter.com/j0k))): without his help on many technical subjects, wallabag v2 wouldn't exist. **Merci Jérémy**!

Managing such a project like wallabag is so exciting (but it's also very tiring). Today, it's a big part of my personal life, that's why I also want to thank my wife, because it's not easy every day to share your life with a wallaby. **Merci Audrey**!

Enough with this...

## wallabag 2.0.0 is here!

### Download wallabag 2.0.0

### On a dedicated web server

If you don't have it yet, please [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). Then you can install wallabag by executing the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag.git
cd wallabag
git checkout 2.0.0
SYMFONY_ENV=prod composer install --no-dev -o --prefer-dist
php bin/console wallabag:install --env=prod
php bin/console server:run --env=prod
```

### On a shared hosting

We provide you a package, `wallabag-2.0.0.tar.gz`, with all dependancies inside.

The default configuration uses SQLite for the database. If you want to change these settings, please edit `app/config/parameters.yml`.

We already created a user (login and password are `wallabag`). This user is only available if you use SQLite database.

**Warning:** With this package, wallabag don't check mandatory extensions used in the application (theses checks are made during `composer install` when you have a dedicated web server, see above).  
**[Please read our installation documentation to see requirements](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/installation.html)**.

* Download this file here: [http://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package](http://wllbg.org/latest-v2-package)
* Extract it (`tar xvf wallabag-2.0.0.tar.gz`)
* [Read this documentation to create your virtual host](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/installation.html#installing-on-apache)
* If you changed the database configuration to use MySQL or PostgreSQL, you need to create a user via this command `php bin/console wallabag:install --env=prod`.
