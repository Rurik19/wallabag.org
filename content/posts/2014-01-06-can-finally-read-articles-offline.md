title: You can finally read your articles while being offline
tags: android, documentation, v1

Jonathan Gaulupeau has updated our Android application (this version is currently only available on [Google Play]({filename}/download.md)): with this version, you can finally read your articles while being offline.

You have to use poche 1.3 (if your poche is [hosted by us](https://www.framabag.org), it's good for you!) and RSS feeds must be enabled.


### Known issues





	
  * If your poche is hosted by us, there is an encoding problem with titles.

	
  * When you mark as read an entry, this one stays unread on the web application.

	
  * You can't read your archives.

	
  * You can't star, delete your articles. You can only read articles.

	
  * Maybe other problems.


We are so happy with this update! We hope you'll like it too.
