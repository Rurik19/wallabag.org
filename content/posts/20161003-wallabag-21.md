title: [Release] wallabag 2.1, best version since 2.0.0
tags: v2, release

Six months ago, we released wallabag 2.0. A big step in our short life: we rewrote the whole application to propose to you many great features. And it was also easier for us to develop with the help of the Symfony framework

Since this release, we've worked on fixes (we [released 8 patches](https://www.wallabag.org/pages/releases.html)) and we developed many new features for wallabag 2.1.

Now, it's time to take a look at these new features!

## Import from ...

The recent news ([Instapaper is joining Pinterest](http://blog.instapaper.com/post/149374303661), [The Readability bookmarking service will shut down on September 30, 2016](https://medium.com/@readability/the-readability-bookmarking-service-will-shut-down-on-september-30-2016-1641cc18e02b#.jzcn686qt)) in the read-it-later ecosystem encouraged us to change our roadmap. We planned to work on the Tags feature for this 2.1 version but we worked hard on importing your data from 3rd-party services (but we've also made few things on Tags !).

    <h3>... from Readability</h3>
    <p>At the end of August, Readability announced that its general public service will shut down on September 30. One day after this announce, j0k3r developed a Readability import. It's easy to use, you just need to select your Readability export on your computer and import it.</p>

    <p>Instapaper service will not shut down (at least not right now), but it has been acquired by Pinterest. If you think that it's time to migrate to wallabag, our new importer is for you.</p>

    <p>In your favorite browser, you can save bookmarks, thousands of bookmarks. Now, you can also import them into wallabag. It's a just a file to export from your browser and import into your wallabag interface.</p>

## Asynchronous import will save your life (and your server!)

OK, you can import thousand of articles, but your web server can't process so much data: you'll most probably end up with a timeout error if you try to import too many articles. 

[This problem exists in wallabag for years](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20import%20fail%20is%3Aclosed%20).

That's why we worked on a system to fetch content and import articles into wallabag asynchronously: you ask wallabag to import your articles, wallabag saves all the URLs of these articles and then, a queue system fetches content while you're using wallabag. 

In order to use this feature, wallabag needs [Redis](http://redis.io/) or [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). The wallabag documentation explains how to configure these services.
